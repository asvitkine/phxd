Version 0.2.9, March 3, 2004
============================
- fixed a buffer overflow in htrk_send_list of tracker.c:301 caused by not
  properly reallocating the buffer before annexing secondary tracker headers
  which are sent after 8K of data

Version 0.2.8, February 21, 2004
================================
- fixed buffer overflow when reading ./etc/custom_list
- fixed bug that caused the last line of custom_list to be ignored
- "recvfrom: connection reset by peer" is no longer logged
- you can now put a newline after the comma before the description to signify
  that there is no description (before you had to put something, like a space)

Version 0.2.7, February 7, 2004
===============================
- fixed mid-buffered read with custom_list if the file was over 1024 characters
- added "log_incorrect_password", "log_banned_register", and "log_banned_list"
  to the log section of etc/hxtrackd.conf (all logging is disabled by default)
- added "ignore_passwords" option to tracker section of etc/hxtrackd.conf
- added address:port to bind error log entry
- added address to recvfrom error log entry in tracker_udp_ready_read
- port 5500 is now used as a default if no port is specified in etc/custom_list

Version 0.2.6, January 22, 2004
===============================
- moved configuration files to ./etc
- added conditional compilation of hxd port checking in tracker.c (enabled
  by default)
- added ./etc/custom_list (and path to hxtrackd.conf) for creating custom
  list entries that appear atop the list
- known bug, using ip's that start with 0 in custom_list cause problems

Version 0.2.5, September 19, 2003
=================================
- fixed duplicate entry bug (details: for security purposes, the tracker was
  expecting that all registrations be done over a single socket and would
  therefore have the same source port each time. This would mean that the
  tracker listing could only be spoofed if an attacker were to try spoofing
  the address and discover the source port eventually by trying all 65535
  possibilities. the tracker was to create a single listing for each ip/source-
  port combination. however, this creates duplicates when an official server
  registers because the registrations are not done over a single socket. the
  software closes and re-opens a new socket each time causing a new source port
  to be used, hence causing a new entry to appear. Multiple entries were
  visible because the hotline server would register again before the last
  registration expired). I do not consider this as a bug but a security
  feature which must be removed because of insecure official software. I have
  actually come up with a happy medium. hxd servers send an id of 0 so they
  are identifiable. So hxd servers will still be required to use a single
  socket and will not be spoofable while servers who report an id of non zero
  will be interrogated as to the port of the hotline server they are
  registering.)

Version 0.2.4, September 17, 2003
============================
- fixed cpu bug caused by not clearing closed client connections
- added port options to hxtrackd.conf
- added log section to hxtrackd.conf to customize verbosity level

  expiration, incorrect passwords, requests from banned users and malformed
  datagram errors)
- fixed compiler warning of implicit declaration of inet_ntoa_r in tracker.c
  when the system did not provide the function
- added client_banlist for denying specific addresses the ability to list

Version 0.2, Feb 4, 2003
