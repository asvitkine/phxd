Requirements:
=============

   ANSI C Compiler (like gcc)


Quick and Dirty:
================

   To compile it:

      $ ./configure
      $ make

   To run it (you won't be able to use your shell after this):

      $ cd run
      $ ./hxtrackd

   To run it in the background (this will return your shell to you):

      $ ./hxtrackd &


Details:
========

   To get info on available options for configure:

      $ ./configure --help

   The syntax for the daemon:

      hxtrackd [-d] [-f hxtrackd.conf]

      Options:
         -f     the config file hxtrackd should use
                     (defaults to `./etc/hxtrackd.conf')

         -d     detach from associated terminal (run in background)
                     (this is the same as saying `./hxtrackd &')


Info:
=====

   After you run make, hxtrackd will be in the `run' directory. You can
   simply copy this directory anywhere you want. It contains all
   the files necessary to run hxtrackd (or run `make install' to install
   it into /usr/local/hxtrackd').


Make Directives:
================

   Compile the requested items from ./configure:
   
      $ make

   Install hxtrackd:

      $ make install

   Delete all the compiled object files (*.o files) and core dump files:

      $ make clean

   Return the folder back to it's initial state:

      $ make distclean

   Create a tarball of the source

      $ make tgz

   Similar to above

      $ make targz
