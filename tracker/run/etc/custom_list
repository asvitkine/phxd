# Custom list entries. Entries will appear at the top of the list in order
# as they appear in this file.
#
# Format:  ip/host:port,name,users,description
# example: 1.2.3.4:5500,foobar,0,your message here.
#
# Lines beginning with `#' will be ignored. Spaces in between commas will not
# be ignored. For example, "127.0.0.1:5500, localhost, 5, my computer" will
# have a space at the beginning of the name and description and the users will
# be considered an invalid number.
#
# You can optionally not put the port, and 5500 will be used by default.
