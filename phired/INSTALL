PREREQUISITES
=============

To install the Wired server, you need the following prerequisites:

    1. OpenSSL Library
       http://www.openssl.org/source/

These are usually distributed with operating systems.


INSTALLATION
============

To install the Wired server, follow these instructions:

    1. Unpack the tarball:

         tar -xzf wired-X.X.tar.gz
         cd wired-X.X.tar.gz

    2. Run the configuration script:

         ./configure

       This will install the Wired server into /usr/local by default. To
       change this, instead run:

         ./configure --prefix=/path

       To change the default user the installation will write files as,
       run:

         ./configure --with-user=USER

    3. Run make. Note, GNU make is required.

         gmake

    4. If make is successful, install the software:

         gmake install

       This will require write permissions to /usr/local/wired, or
       whatever directory you set as the prefix above.


RUNNING
=======

To start an installed Wired server, run:

    /usr/local/wired/wiredctl start

By default a user with the login "admin" and no password is created.
