you need an ANSI C compiler, preferably the GNU C compiler, to compile hxd.
traditional compilers may work, if they understand function prototypes.
the ultrix 4.3 compiler does, if your compiler does not, try ansi2knr.

if you run into problems building or running, you might want to read PROBLEMS.

hx client
=========
to compile the client:
$ ./configure
$ make

to start it:
$ ./hx

you may need to get libreadline from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/

soundsets are loaded with snd -S sndset_file
turn sounds on/off with snd -O/-o

ghx client
==========
to compile:
$ ./configure --enable-gtk
$ make

specify icon files with icon_files[i]=...
user icon files with user_icon_files[i]=...
files with lower indexen are loaded first
for example:
icon_files[0]=icons.rsrc
user_icon_files[0]=bm_icons.rsrc
user_icon_files[1]=icons.rsrc

SOCKS
=====
hx can use the socks5 library from http://www.socks.nec.com/
use the --with-socks and/or --with-socks-include configure options.
