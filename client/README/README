Hello. Thankyou for using shx.

Synapse Hotline X (shx or SHX) is hx with modifications and bug fixes.

Right now, the version numbering is still based off of hx/hxd's version where Ror
left off (if you don't know by now, hxd has been abandoned by it's creator(s)).

As of shx/shxd 0.1.47 the client has been removed from the hxd (server) package
and is offered as a separate download. This is the client package which
includes hx and a GUI (GTK+) frontend for it.
