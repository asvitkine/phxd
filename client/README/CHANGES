Version 0.2.1 December 27, 2002

Version 0.2 December 17, 2002

Version 0.1.47 August 29, 2001
==============================
- added version chat command to hxd (outputs server version)
- fixed overrun memory problem in users command
- added more security to command output (ensuring someone can't crash the
  server on a lagged line causing data to be sent to a vaporized socket)
- fixed find script to use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash
- fixed problem causing find script to output on same line as chat if chat was
  sent during a find
- added command escaping ("\/help" outputs "/help" to chat)
- changed default unknown type/creator of unknown files to ????/????

Version 0.1.46.1 August 26, 2001
================================
- fixed problem in hx (missing newline in pchats)

Version 0.1.46 August 26, 2001
==============================
- added official install-sh script to detect the host type (with config.guess
  and config.sub)(so that we can detect Darwin)
- disabled libtermcap.so library checking on Darwin systems (tgetent is defined
  in the readline lib so termcap is unnecessary)
- added default icon to access file
- added internal detection of HL1.5+ clients
- added support for TIDE authentication routines
- fixed the pthread bug that causes the server to report that there are 65535
  downloads in process and that the maximum number of downloads has been reached
- added redeclaration of pthread_kill (to kill) for OS X (note: this never
  caused a leak, the problem was simply what was fixed above)
- added support in ./exec/find for deprecated find functions (Darwin has an old
  find function, this is to support it)(note: read the comments in ./exec/find)
- packaged up GNU find 4.1 binary for OS X users (it's on the site)
- added ability to change your icon even if you do not have the privelege to
  use any name (this may have been considered a bug)
- added remote server queueing (available only with --enable-htxf-clone right
  now, I'm working on patching it to work with pthreads/fork/normal)
- added small document (./info/HowTo) to explain remote queueing

Version 0.1.45.3 August 22, 2001
================================
- fixed 'skewed clock' error on OS X

Version 0.1.45.2 August 22, 2001
================================
- fixed readline/libtermcap.so bug for Suse 7.1, Mandrake 8, and Yellow Dog
  Linux 2 (this is a bug in the Operating System related to the packaging
  system, i just added a fix for it)

Version 0.1.45, August 21, 2001
===============================
- temporarily commented out the pthread fix for os x (causes a leak)
- it now compiles without --enable-exec (oops?)

Version 0.1.44, August 20, 2001
==============================
- fixed bug in find (unnecessary appended "/files/" to result)
- moved documentation to ./info
- added documentation on 'conf' files (./info/confFiles)
- you can now always get info on yourself
- fixed bug that caused "hxd: color: command not found" to be posted when
  "/color" was entered
- added a work around for HL 1.5+ clients. Adding the ability to get info on
  yourself wasn't enough. Because the HL 1.5+ clients disable the button if you
  don't have the privelege. So i added a work around that reports on login that
  you have the priv and then after sending it, sets it back to it's true value.
  So the client always has the button enabled.
- added users chat command (allows you to see invisible users)
- added manage_users access property for accounts
- added color access property for accounts (this acts as a default for the
  account, if color is defined then the account will use that color at login)
- added ability to have more whitespace in the access file (for example:
  "user_0wn = 1" or "   user_0wn = 1" is now possible; previously only
  "user_0wn=1" and "user_0wn= 1" was allowed)
- fixed bug where you couldn't see the file transfer rate on Mac OS X
  (note: configure with --enable-htxf-pthread)
- fixed gcc warning when configured with --enable-htxf-pthread
- find now prunes "Icon^M" files (^M is a carriage return)(these files are used
  by the macintosh to display custom icons for folders)
- fixed bug that caused all files/folders beginning with "Icon" to be pruned
  rather than files named "Icon\r" (\r is a carriage return) to be pruned in
  the file list
- found a bug where output from the exec command (including find) was split
  into 4K chunks, meaning if you did a large find you would get multiple
  private messages. The solution was to remove the previously added feature
  where exec output was relayed to private message and put it back to text so
  that the output looks contigous
- added a feature that makes exec output relay to the private chat the command
  originated from (relays to public chat if originated from public chat)
- increased login timeout to 60 seconds
- rewrote find shell script! (works exactly as desired now)
- added patch to configure.in to fix mdk8 readline problem (submitted by ZapF)
- fixed bug in hx where irregular chat text being recieved was formatted
  incorrectly (ex. an exec script says "echo hello;" hx says "<hello> hello")
- fixed exec vulnerability (if the user started a lengthy exec process and then
  logged out before the results were sent completely, the server crashed).
- added hxd.config feature 'total_exec' and 'individual_exec' so that the
  server can not be so easily brought down by overloading it with exec

Version 0.1.43, August 6, 2001
==============================
- fixed bug with "hxd: <command>: command not found"
- fixed bug with find ("find: /home/Software/files/: No such file or
  directory")
- reimplemented support to hide macintosh volume specific files/folders (don't
  know how that one got lost before the final tarball, huh)
- added comprehensive documentation on all the HXD commands
- added documentation on all the access extras
- removed the 'net' account
- fixed gcc compile warnings

=============================

- rerouted exec output to private message
- added support to hide macintosh volume specific files/folders
- added help chat command displays a list of commands to the user
- added default exec output to output "hxd: <command>: command not found" if an
  unknown command is passed to the server
- you can no longer get info on invisible users (this makes it more difficult
  for some clients [hx, hotstuff, panorama] to see invisible users)
- Added CARBON definition to detect the Carbon API on Mac OS X
- Added /help <command> command to hx (get info on individual commands)
