Mac OS X
========
*****pthreads*****

Mac OS X has a deprecated find version. It doesn't support -iname
(case-insensitive searching) or -printf (output formatting). Two options that
are used in the find script. In order to fix the find script...

change:
deprecated_find=0;

to:
deprecated_find=1;

If you wish to go the other route and upgrade the find utility in OS X
(darwin), it's a very easy process. Simply download the GNU find 4.1 Darwin
that i packaged and run install.sh

http://synhxd.sourceforge.net/darwin_gnufind.tgz

*****remote queueing*****

due to the lack of poll on the darwin/Mac OS X system, remote queueing is not
available to it yet. Working on a port to select (the darwin poll alternative)

AIX
===
due to bugs in L. Ron Hubbard knows what, configure will
generate a broken config.h on a version of AIX.

change:
#define u_int8_t unsigned char char
#define u_int16_t unsigned short short
#undef u_int32_t
#undef HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H

to:
#define u_int8_t unsigned char
#define u_int16_t unsigned short
#define u_int32_t unsigned int
#define HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H

BSDI
====
gcc version 2.7.2.1 on the BSDI system I used did not compile
hxd correctly.
gcc 1.42 worked, on the system i used this was `cc'.

HPUX
====
with sql you might need to link with -lm

NextStep
========
use gcc -posix
malloc does not work when linking with -lposix, so you must extract the object
files needed from libposix.a and link with those.

OpenBSD / gcc 2.8.1
===================
On OpenBSD with gcc 2.8.1, if you get a core dump in hlwrite, try compiling
without optimization, this works a little better, but get a working compiler.
