For the graphical gtk+ client you need to --enable-gtk, if you want idled users
icons to be dulled --enable-dulled as well.

edit $HOME/.hxvars

and add
user_icon_files[0]='/home/david/zombie.rsrc'
icon_files[0]='/home/david/icons.rsrc'


user_icon_files[0] is the userlist icons to use..
icon_files[0] is the icon set to use for buttons.

get userlist icons from http://badmoon.org and the button icons from
http://hx.fortyoz.org.

this client by no means is complete but is quite usable.
