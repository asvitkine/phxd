Things to do...

This file contains a list of things that i want to accomplish for both hx AND
hxd. This file is not a promise on my part to deliver the goods. It is merely a
tracking list of ideas that surface in my many wanderings. Feel free to partake
of my stringy soup of festive maticulations, happy mastication fellow user.

In Progress
===========
- Modularize hxd

High Priority
=============
- modularize hx
- Add /priv
- Add standardized errors messages
- All the commands in hx that use uid, you can optionally use the user's
  nickname (or part of a user's nickname), i will make it the same way with hxd
- Change default location for mysql from /usr to /usr/local (mysql default
  install location)
- Add "permission denied" output to commands that are denied because of access
- Add server side help on commands
- Add write pid patch, uid patch (made by sam)

Mediana Prioritaia
==================
- Add Mac Alias resolving
- Add support for Mac Invisible files
- Add support for Darwin HFS resource forks
- Make the comments for files be held in the file (added via Carbon API) rather
  than in .finderinfo
- Add package support (so that packages on OS X show as single files and you
  can download them as folders)
- Add API type/creator sniffing for OS X
- Add /info command (returns the contents of the info file defined in hxd.conf)
  good for supplying server information
- Make it so people can't message flood (drawing an rfc on this, we'll see if
  it flies)
- Add /1..9 commands to quickly switch between chats (/0 is pub chat) first 9
  chats are mapped in ascending order, further chats are not mapped. You can
  remap a chat with /mapchat <cid> <#> (0 removes the map).
- Make multiple exec statements close together considered spam. (so it's even
  harder bordering on nearly impossible to overload the server)(this is just
  here for notes, this actually would fall under the rfc for antispam)
- Add conn_max and individual_exec to the account conf file parsing

Low Priority
============
- Add .hxdaccess feature
- Add options in access to exclude info (ex. "address: <denied>")
- Change the info dialog to show more (accurate) info and how long the user has
  been in a certain state (active, inactive, etc.)
- Add secure pchat (only people who are invited can enter)
- Add optional message parameter to kick and ban to issue a final message to
  the victim
- Add $HXDOUTPUT environment variable for shell scripts (so the script can
  decide whether it outputs to chat or if it outputs to a private message)
- Add hxd.login for accounts (shell script executed on login)

Back Burner
===========
- Add groups system
- Add threaded news
- Add administer accounts (HL 1.8 feature)
- Fix network feature (don't even know what's wrong with it; more testing
  required)
- Add separate file for extension mapping on non-os x systems (like netatalk)

Blorkified Idears
=================
- Add /me command
- Add selective chat (/whisper)
- Do not allow users to give themselves more priveleges or give others more
  priveleges than they have themselves (including new accounts they create)
- Add /kick &account (will kick an entire account, example: /kick &guest)
  (tell me what you think of this one... i'm not sure, sounds ok)
- Add 'less' style news to hx (think we found a better way)
