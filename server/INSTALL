Requirements:
=============

   ANSI C Compiler (like gcc)


Quick and Dirty:
================

   To compile it (the enable part is not required but is recommended):

      $ ./configure --enable-htxf-pthread
      $ make
      $ make install

   To run it (you won't be able to use your shell after this):

      $ ./hxd

   To run it in the background (this will return your shell to you):

      $ ./hxd &


Details:
========

   To get info on available options for configure:

      $ ./configure --help

   The syntax for the daemon:

      hxd [-d] [-p port] [-f hxd.conf] [-o pidfile]

      Options:
         -p     the port hxd should listen on
                     (defaults to 5500)

         -f     the config file hxd should use
                     (defaults to `./hxd.conf')

         -d     detach from associated terminal (run in background)
                     (this is the same as saying `./hxd &')

         -o     output pid to specified file
                     (no pid is output by default)


Info:
=====

   After you run make, hxd will be in the `run' directory. You can
   simply copy this directory anywhere you want. It contains all
   the files necessary to run hxd (or run `make install' to install
   it into /usr/local/hxd'.

   If things don't go smoothly along, take a gander at 'doc/Problems'.

   To register with a tracker edit the tracker section of hxd.conf

   To compile the tracker server:

      $ ./configure --enable-tracker-server
      $ make


Make Directives:
================

   Compile the requested items from ./configure :
   
      $ make

   Install hxd:

      $ make install

   Compile the account editor (acctedit):
   when running acctedit: return toggles access, s saves, q quits.

      $ make acctedit

   Compile tracker list utility:

      $ make tlist

   Delete all the compile object files (*.o files) and core dump files:

      $ make clean

   Return the folder back to it's initial state:

      $ make distclean

   Create a tarball of the source

      $ make tgz

   Similar to above

      $ make targz
