This folder contains some useful programs i've written.

mkbin
=====
Compiles a list of binaries that can be re-distributed. It
automatically generates as many binaries as possible based
on which options will compile on your system. It doesn't
compile *every* possible binary, just the most common ones
that people use.

bashmkbin
=========
Uses a mathematical formula to compile a list of binaries
that can be re-distributed. It automatically generates as
many binaries as possible using algorithms to pair enable
options with each other to make each unique combination.
Unlike the above mkbin script it compiles *every* possible
binary. The drawback is that it requires bash to run.

isalias
=======
Uses the Mac OS X API (CoreServices) to test a file if it
is an alias. If it is, it resolves the alias and displays
the path. To make this program, while in the utils folder
of shxd, do the following:

   $ make isalias

getudbit
========
A utility to get the privelege bits of a UserData file
from the command line without user interaction. Simply
pass it the path to the UserData file and the bit that you
want in either numeral form or name. It returns 0 if the
bit is not set and 1 if the bit is set. To compile it:

   $ make getudbit

setudbit
========
A utility to set the privelege bits of a UserData file
from the command line without user interaction. Simply
pass it the path to the UserData file and the bit that you
want in either numeral form or name.

   $ make setudbit
