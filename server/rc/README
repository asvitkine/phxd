This folder contains a set of rc boot scripts for hxd.

As of this writing there is only one. A simple rc script
that will work on most operating systems. It calls hxd,
and asks it to store a pid file which the script can
use to track the process for stopping, starting,
restarting, and reloading it.

To set up the script to make it run your hotline
server at boot time, follow the instructions below.

On debian systems:

   Put the rc script in:

      /etc/init.d

   Then run the following command:

      % update-rc.d hxd.rc start 20 2 3 4 5 . stop 0 1 6 .
   
On Mandrake systems

   Put the rc script in:

      /etc/rc.d/init.d

   That's it

On Mac OS X

   I'm not sure quite yet on where to put it or if
   it's even compatible. There is a set of os x rc
   scripts on my hotline server.
