Things to do...

This file contains a list of things that i want to accomplish for both hx AND
hxd. This file is not a promise on my part to deliver the goods. It is merely a
tracking list of ideas that surface in my many wanderings. Feel free to partake
of my stringy soup of festive maticulations, happy mastication fellow user.

  regardless of limits imposed on transfers

  to the victim

  can decide whether it outputs to chat or if it outputs to a private message)
- [hxd] Do not allow users to give themselves more priveleges or give others
  more priveleges than they have themselves (including new accounts they
  create).
