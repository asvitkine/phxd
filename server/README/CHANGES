- changed makefile to output directly to run dir rather than move it
- added logging of kick, ban, access, and 0wn

- fixed incorrect conditionals for commands, end result of the bug was that
  you couldn't run any exec scripts that happen to start with the letter 'b'
  unless you ran them with '/exec'
- added script engine that calls 2 distinct shell scripts. one when a new user
  is added (by default it copies a set of default files in ./etc/skel to their
  new user directory) and one that is executed when a user is deleted (by
  default this script removes their account directory). two environment
  variables are declared for these scripts. `$ACCOUNTDIR' (the location of the
  account directory) and `$USER' (the name of the user/dir in the account dir)
  (the location of these scripts is customizable in hxd.conf; in ./etc by
  default)

- changed the exec log format (now it's "name:login:uid - exec command")
- added "permission denied" logging to chat when an exec command requires more
  permissions to be executed by the person
- added "no such user" logging to chat when a command that takes a uid as a
  parameter cannot find the specified user with the supplied uid

  0wned or accessed is attempted to be modified
- added syntax parsing and chat logging to access and 0wn
- added partial nick name usage for 0wn, access, alert, and mon commands so
  that you can use a person's nick name or beginning of their name instead of
  their uid
- fixed 0wn, access, alert, and mon commands to be able to take zero as a uid
- mon command now sends updated priveleges after being used on someone
- fixed hxtrackd compile on os x
- added ability to make account based drop boxes by making a symlink to a
  directory at `accounts/blah/dropbox' (symlinked to a location in files)
- fixed problem where frogblast 1.2.3 would not go away
- added ping to frogblast 1.2.3 users to make sure they don't timeout
- added "version" info to user information (displays client info)
- improved login performance (threaded host resolving, enable clone or pthread)
- added login script executed every time a user logs in (works like an exec,
  output is forwarded to their chat)(feature disabled by default)
- fixed default comments for all files and folders to be exactly
  "ftp.microsoft.com". If the comment on a file is not that, it seems that pc
  clients have trouble downloading the file

Version 0.2.9 September 9, 2002
===============================
- added "cipher_only" option to the config file to deny non-ciphered clients
  access when cipher/hope are enabled (see `cipher' section in hxd.conf)

  problems with file transfers dieing at the end on certain systems.

Version 0.2.8 August 15, 2002
=============================
- finally fixed (i guarantee this time) the account based drop boxes
- pinned down an odd bug that has been plagueing people for a long time
  regarding symlinks/aliases and not being able to browse more than one or two
  levels deep. wasn't able to fix it but the workaround is to name the symlink
  with more than 8 characters in the name (yes this sounds wierd, but trust me)
- find script 1.1. enhanced the -q option to be even more quient and elegant.

Version 0.2.7 August 6, 2002
============================
- fixed a bug causing unpriveleged users to not be able to see the contents of
  normal folders

Version 0.2.6 August 1, 2002
===========================
- fixed a rorschach anomaly that disallowed uploading to your own account's
  drop box (accounts/name/dropbox)
- added `info_get_address' and `info_get_login' access properties
- cache hostname resolutions now so that getting info doesn't do resolve it
  every time and so that it doesn't lag when getting info for ip's that take
  a long time to resolve (resolution is done as the *last* step to login now)
- fixed another ancient ror problem where anybody could see the contents of an
  account based drop box (where it's *supposed* to be that only the account
  holder of the box and people that can view drop boxes can see it's contents)
  for info on creating account based drop boxes see `doc/dropbox'
- added new feature to the `find' script that if `getudbit' is installed then
  it will use it to check if the person calling the script has priveleges to
  view the contents of drop boxes, and if so, will allow finding in them
- seen script also now uses getudbit if installed to check for permission to
  execute it (checks for privelege to disconnect users)
- added `accounts' script which displays the names of all accounts on the
  server. (if getudbit is installed it checks for the privelege to read
  accounts to be executed).
- added `-s' option to accounts script to save a preset width (requires admin
  or if getudbit is installed, modify users privelege)
- house cleaning on some exec scripts make them more efficient (like ? script)

Version 0.2.5 May 3, 2002
==========================
- fixed `/broadcast' buffer problem
- added ip resolution to get-info (donated by kang)

- updated INSTALL file to fix some inconsistencies
- fixed a bug where people that were away didn't change color upon changing
  account priveleges

Version 0.2.3 April 10, 2002
============================
- fixed a bug where if you 0wned someone while they were
  invisible, you couldn't get info on them after they
  appeared. Now, invisible people stay invisible unless 0wned
  visible. name 0wning is not effective until they are 0wned
  visible again (FYI).

Version 0.2.2 April 4, 2002
===========================
- changed output of `/version' from `hxd ver...' to `shxd ver...'
  (since both shxd and hxd are in the 0.2.x version system now)
- created a new mkbin script (read the agreement in the source of
  the file, or don't run it)(file is `utils/bashmkbin')

Version 0.2.1
=============

  (also removed an extra space from it that was showing up)
- fixed the cgi version of netstat and changed the configure format
  to use variable names rather than printf formatting (so you can
  opt to not display certain information or rearrange it)
- moved the "logged in since" and "idle since" info above the
  active downloads (some clients were counting this info as an
  active upload)
- fixed `/? -r' on os x (should have returned "permission denied")
- modified /users output
- added standard make success output for clarity of status
- fixed clone compile for debian stable
- added -q and -v flags to /find

  --enable-cipher
- removed `--enable-hfs', `--enable-winclient-fix', `--enable-nospam',
  `--enable-tracker-register', and `--enable-exec' from the compile
  options. they are now options in `hxd.conf'.
- updated mkbin script
- configure now caches coreservices results
- added emulation section to hxd.conf (emulate features of other hotline
  servers by customizing these settings)(so far, ignore_commands and
  self_info)
- user_change events and updated priveleges are sent to clients when you
  edit an account now (no need to log out and back in for effects anymore)
- fixed `make install` (doesn't re-link the binary before installing)
- added /me command (for clients without support for it locally)
- fixed "Can Use Any Name" to use account name in chat if user had logged
  in while he could use any name
- client name is stored upon login so if "Can Use Any Name" is off and it
  is turned on, the client's preferred name is shown.
- when "Can Use Any Name" is off and client changes name, the name is
  stored so if "Can Use Any Name" is turned on, the recent name is shown
- changed default news separator so that it fits default 1.8.5 PC news
  window size
- removed echo script
- added new "seen" script to check log file for time/date of a particular
  string to match (ex. `/seen joe' to see when joe was last in the log)
- moved ror's misc files to ./rorsch
- made isalias standalone test app (see `utils/README')
- added normal account privs to /access command
- fixed --enable-tracker-server (hotline server would compile with it)
- fixed bug where a person whom acquires red-ness from an account change would
  use old color at away time opposed to new color
- when you change the name on an account now, all the users that are using that
  account (if "Use Any Name" is false) will update to that name.
- cleaned up a lot of code
- changed exec limit alert style and text
- added default comment for directories that don't have one
- size of files are now the same in the file list and the `file info' box
- added `kick_transients' option to hxd.conf to kick people connected to the

- fixed instance where pthreads would crash hxd when cancelling
  transfers after attempting to exceed individual transfer limits
- worked on exec scripts heavily
- added syntax option `-o pidfile'
- added mkbin script (in `utils' dir). makes binary tarballs for you.
- rewrote the find script and added output match length restriction.
  this makes it incredibly difficult (if possible at all) to crash
  the server using the find script.
- made an rc script using the new pid output syntax (in `rc' dir).
- made find script able to determine whether to use BSD standards or
  GNU standards on it's own. it's also now compatible with OpenBSD

==============================
- added official install-sh script to detect the host type (with config.guess
  and config.sub)(so that we can detect Darwin)
- disabled libtermcap.so library checking on Darwin systems (tgetent is defined
  in the readline lib so termcap is unnecessary)
- added default icon to access file
- added internal detection of HL1.5+ clients
- added support for TIDE authentication routines
- fixed the pthread bug that causes the server to report that there are 65535
  downloads in process and that the maximum number of downloads has been reached
- added redeclaration of pthread_kill (to kill) for OS X (note: this never
  caused a leak, the problem was simply what was fixed above)
- added support in ./exec/find for deprecated find functions (Darwin has an old
  find function, this is to support it)(note: read the comments in ./exec/find)
- packaged up GNU find 4.1 binary for OS X users (it's on the site)
- added ability to change your icon even if you do not have the privelege to
  use any name (this may have been considered a bug)
- added remote server queueing (available only with --enable-htxf-clone right
  now, I'm working on patching it to work with pthreads/fork/normal)
- added small document (./info/HowTo) to explain remote queueing

Version 0.1.45.3 August 22, 2001
================================
- fixed 'skewed clock' error on OS X

Version 0.1.45.2 August 22, 2001
================================
- fixed readline/libtermcap.so bug for Suse 7.1, Mandrake 8, and Yellow Dog
  Linux 2 (this is a bug in the Operating System related to the packaging
  system, i just added a fix for it)

Version 0.1.45, August 21, 2001
===============================
- temporarily commented out the pthread fix for os x (causes a leak)
- it now compiles without --enable-exec (oops?)

Version 0.1.44, August 20, 2001
==============================
- fixed bug in find (unnecessary appended "/files/" to result)
- moved documentation to ./info
- added documentation on 'conf' files (./info/confFiles)
- you can now always get info on yourself
- fixed bug that caused "hxd: color: command not found" to be posted when
  "/color" was entered
- added a work around for HL 1.5+ clients. Adding the ability to get info on
  yourself wasn't enough. Because the HL 1.5+ clients disable the button if you
  don't have the privelege. So i added a work around that reports on login that
  you have the priv and then after sending it, sets it back to it's true value.
  So the client always has the button enabled.
- added users chat command (allows you to see invisible users)
- added manage_users access property for accounts
- added color access property for accounts (this acts as a default for the
  account, if color is defined then the account will use that color at login)
- added ability to have more whitespace in the access file (for example:
  "user_0wn = 1" or "   user_0wn = 1" is now possible; previously only
  "user_0wn=1" and "user_0wn= 1" was allowed)
- fixed bug where you couldn't see the file transfer rate on Mac OS X
  (note: configure with --enable-htxf-pthread)
- fixed gcc warning when configured with --enable-htxf-pthread
- find now prunes "Icon^M" files (^M is a carriage return)(these files are used
  by the macintosh to display custom icons for folders)
- fixed bug that caused all files/folders beginning with "Icon" to be pruned
  rather than files named "Icon\r" (\r is a carriage return) to be pruned in
  the file list
- found a bug where output from the exec command (including find) was split
  into 4K chunks, meaning if you did a large find you would get multiple
  private messages. The solution was to remove the previously added feature
  where exec output was relayed to private message and put it back to text so
  that the output looks contigous
- added a feature that makes exec output relay to the private chat the command
  originated from (relays to public chat if originated from public chat)
- increased login timeout to 60 seconds
- rewrote find shell script! (works exactly as desired now)
- added patch to configure.in to fix mdk8 readline problem (submitted by ZapF)
- fixed bug in hx where irregular chat text being recieved was formatted
  incorrectly (ex. an exec script says "echo hello;" hx says "<hello> hello")
- fixed exec vulnerability (if the user started a lengthy exec process and then
  logged out before the results were sent completely, the server crashed).
- added hxd.conf feature 'total_exec' and 'individual_exec' so that the
  server can not be so easily brought down by overloading it with exec

Version 0.1.43, August 6, 2001
==============================
- fixed bug with "hxd: <command>: command not found"
- fixed bug with find ("find: /home/Software/files/: No such file or
  directory")

- added documentation on all the access extras
- removed the 'net' account
- fixed gcc compile warnings

Version 0.1.42, June 30, 2001
=============================

- added alert chat command
- added '\' alternative chat command character
- modified find chat command to be more efficient and verbose
- rerouted exec output to private message
- added support to hide macintosh volume specific files/folders
- added help chat command displays a list of commands to the user
- added default exec output to output "hxd: <command>: command not found" if an
  unknown command is passed to the server
- you can no longer get info on invisible users (this makes it more difficult
  for some clients [hx, hotstuff, panorama] to see invisible users)
- Added CARBON definition to detect the Carbon API on Mac OS X
- Added /help <command> command to hx (get info on individual commands)

Version 0.1.41, May 12, 2001
