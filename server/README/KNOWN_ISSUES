Known Issues:

1. attempting to download a file from an alias that points to the file
   downloads the data fork of the alias (creating a null file of size 0
   bytes)
2. clone doesn't compile on debian 2.x
3. remote queueing doesn't work (when clone is enabled)
4. SIGTSTP (aka. suspend, triggered by control-z) doesn't suspend shxd
5. if you delete the log file while the server is running it won't be recreated
   until you start the server up again
6. compress only works when hope is enabled and client is hope'd
7. sql and hope options conflict with ipv6 option
8. on os x, if you enable cipher, your server will crash if a person is
   disconnected while downloading

Temporary Solutions:

1. don't create aliases to files (if you *really* need a file to be in two
   places at once, use symlinks for now)
2. upgrade to debian 3.0 if you can, otherwise wait for a fix
3. not much you can do, if it's broke, it's broke. wait for a fix
4. this is on purpose and was for development reasons. use shxd in `screen'
   if you need to be able to switch out from a fixed process.
5. SIGHUP the server after deleting the log file and it will be recreated
6. this is not really a bug but a requirement, i will try to remove the
   requirement much later on, but it's out of my realm right now as I am
   much more focused and tuned in on other things
7. you can try to compile ipv6 with sql and/or hope enabled but it will
   probably fail with an error. just compile without sql and hope to get ipv6
   support.
8. don't enable cipher. it doesn't crash with just hope enabled, so if you need
   hope (ie. to use compress) then that is ok. Otherwise consider other
   other platforms if you need cipher support. We believe it has something to
   do with the openssl on os x.
